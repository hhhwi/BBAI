File one: HOW TO OPTIMIZE SUBOPTIMAL CODE.

The user may ask for help from you to fix/ troubleshoot he's code so along the way optimize the code before you give it to him




Or he might directly ask for you to optimize his code

Example querys




I want a script that gives the player a diamond every time they break any block. Can you make this better?"

import { world } from "@minecraft/server";

world.afterEvents.playerBreakBlock.subscribe((data) => {
  let player = data.player;
  if (player != undefined) {
    player.runCommand("give @p diamond 1");
  } else {
    return;
  }
});

Why This Code is "Bad":

1. Unnecessary if Check: The check for if (player != undefined) is redundant because the playerBreakBlock event always provides a player object.


2. Inefficient Command: The runCommand("give @p diamond 1") targets @p, which is not reliable. It could give the item to a different player if they are closer.


3. Lack of Error Handling: There's no handling for potential errors when running the command.


4. Code Redundancy: The else { return; } statement is unnecessary here, as there's no code that needs to run after the if check.




How to optimize it

Code import { world } from "@minecraft/server";

world.afterEvents.playerBreakBlock.subscribe((data) => {
  let player = data.player;    player.runCommand("give @s diamond 1");
});

What changed?

The if statement and the else statements are irrelevant in playerBreakBlock event since as listed in the name it's only triggered if a player broke a block

Using runCommandAsync("command");




Is bad because runCommandAsync only allows for 100 uses of it.
Which means lag spikes

Async means it runs on a sub Asynchronously that doesn't effect performance

Example 1: Inefficient Repeated Database Access

Original Code:

import { world } from "@minecraft/server";

world.afterEvents.playerJoin.subscribe((eventData) => {
  const playerName = eventData.player.name;
  const data = world.runCommand(`scoreboard players list ${playerName}`);
 
  if (data) {
    world.runCommand(`scoreboard players add ${playerName} joined 1`);
  }
});

Issues:

1. Repeated Command Calls: runCommand is used twice, once to fetch and once to update, which is inefficient.


2. Overhead in Command Execution: Using scoreboard players list for each player join can cause lag in large worlds.



Optimized Version:

import { world } from "@minecraft/server";

let playerJoinData = {};

world.afterEvents.playerJoin.subscribe((eventData) => {
  const playerName = eventData.player.name;

  // Use a local object to track joins instead of querying each time
  playerJoinData[playerName] = (playerJoinData[playerName] || 0) + 1;
  world.sendMessage(`${playerName} has joined ${playerJoinData[playerName]} times.`);
});

Explanation:

Use In-Memory Data: Instead of querying the scoreboard, playerJoinData tracks joins locally, reducing command overhead and improving efficiency.

Less Command Usage: Only one message per join, with no scoreboard manipulation, reduces lag in busy servers.

Example 2: Inefficient Loops and Conditionals

Original Code:

import { world } from "@minecraft/server";

world.afterEvents.tick.subscribe(() => {
  world.getAllPlayers().forEach((player) => {
    if (player.hasTag("active")) {
      if (player.getScore("health") < 10) {
        world.runCommand(`tell ${player.name} Your health is low!`);
      }
    }
  });
});

Issues:

1. Nested Conditionals: The double conditionals inside the loop create redundant checks, leading to unnecessary lag.


2. Potential Lag on Every Tick: Running on every tick (20 times per second) is excessive for health checks.



Optimized Version:

import { world, system } from "@minecraft/server";

system.runInterval(() => {
  world.getAllPlayers().filter(player => player.hasTag("active"))
    .forEach(player => {
      if (player.getScore("health") < 10) {
        player.runCommand(`tell @s Your health is low!`);
      }
    });
}, 100); // Run every 5 seconds (100 ticks)

Explanation:

Filter and Simplify: filter() reduces players to only those with the "active" tag before checking health, making it more efficient.

Reduced Frequency: Running every 5 seconds (100 ticks) instead of every tick is sufficient for a health warning, saving resources.

Example 3: Ineffective Event Unsubscription

Original Code:

import { world } from "@minecraft/server";

let counter = 0;

const eventHandler = world.afterEvents.entityHurt.subscribe(() => {
  counter++;
  if (counter > 10) {
    world.afterEvents.entityHurt.unsubscribe(eventHandler); // Unsubscribe after 10 events
  }
});

Issues:

1. Unclear Unsubscription Logic: Storing the handler and unsubscribing later is confusing and risks memory leaks if not carefully managed.


2. Manual Counter Management: Using a counter to unsubscribe from the event is an unreliable way to manage subscriptions.



Optimized Version:

import { world, system } from "@minecraft/server";

let counter = 0;

world.afterEvents.entityHurt.subscribe(() => {
  counter++;
  if (counter > 10) {
    system.run(() => counter = 0); // Reset counter after reaching 10 events
  }
});

Explanation:

Use System Ticks Instead: Here, system tick functions can help manage counters without manually handling events.

Clearer Code: Removing the event unsubscription simplifies the code and minimizes potential memory leaks.

Example 4: Redundant Object Creation and Event Use

Original Code:

import { world } from "@minecraft/server";

world.afterEvents.entityCreate.subscribe((eventData) => {
  const entity = eventData.entity;
  const newObject = {
    name: entity.name,
    type: entity.typeId,
    location: entity.location,
  };
  world.sendMessage(`A new ${newObject.type} was created at ${newObject.location}!`);
});

Issues:

1. Redundant Object Creation: Creating a new object for each entity creation adds overhead and memory usage.


2. Unnecessary Fields: Only the typeId and location are necessary for the message, making name redundant.



Optimized Version:
import { world } from "@minecraft/server";

world.afterEvents.entityCreate.subscribe((eventData) => {
  const { typeId, location } = eventData.entity;
  const formattedLocation = `(${location.x}, ${location.y}, ${location.z})`;
  world.sendMessage(`A new ${typeId} was created at ${formattedLocation}!`);
});

Explanation:

Direct Property Access: Using destructuring to directly access typeId and location saves memory by avoiding unnecessary object creation.

More Efficient Memory Usage: Only relevant properties are accessed, reducing the overhead and simplifying code readability.

These examples help reinforce key concepts:

Reduce Redundant Operations: Avoid repeating actions that don’t need to happen every time.

Use Efficient Data Structures: Rely on in-memory data or destructuring when possible to avoid unnecessary overhead.

Minimize Event Frequency: Use intervals or fewer frequent checks when instant updates aren’t required.
